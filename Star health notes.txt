ip address: 

http://192.168.1.230:8119/  - db 
http://192.168.1.231:8119/  - web

no test it in old one test server itself.
clarified:

1. first i need to run the console application
   which will insert data into star health master
   it contains procedure - star health master data update 
   (in live console applcation is part of scheduler where it takes help of fincale web service and insert data into start health master table)
   so for testing i should i provide data to procedure : star health master data update 
2. Data for star health policy details comes from star health organzation to PDWING
    and PDWNG uses upload engine to upload .txt file using upload id : 5017 so that data is updated into star health details table??


\\192.168.1.93\d- star health update sln run using general way or cikc on star heath update .exe
   to get data inserted into master table 
   

  Notes for me:

   1. run that console applciation present in this path : \\192.168.1.93\d\StarHealth_Update\StarHealth_Update\bin\Debug\StarHealth_Update.exe
      After running ths all proposal details are updated into Start health master table.
   2. these details will be sent to star health insurance org for verfication
   3. Later PDWNG using upload id :5017 will upload file to engine, where it will insert details into star health policy details
   4. Laer we can either inquire details using 9168 Inquire Star Health Policy Details maintenance
   5. Solset Master and sol set items table used in letter module is kept in cbs annex
   6. solset master table is populated data from letter live and using solset items sync procedure we will insert data into sol set items 
      so manually we are not inserting any data into sol set items table.
   7. one Report 4214 is there due for testing at end, once after data everything is proper
   8. For email and sms, run email_start_health_process and take a sanp of 3 emails generated
   9. 1 email is for bank as whole and for Ro's. one is for pending proposals to chairman and sections
   10. for one bank ref no in star health master table, we can have mutiple records for one bank ref no in star health policy with differet status as issued , pending like so
   11. pending policies status means either data for a bank ref no is not present in star health policy or there are present with status as 'P' - Pending
   12. ISHP shortcut is woring or not - should update the menu shortcuts procedure
   13. is 'All' permitted in 9168 ?? - seems it throwed error as 'valid record not found'
   14. Upload engine testing - 5 modes i guess - test all separately
   15. in 5017.txt - if status is issued , then policy number and customer code is to be present.


  upload file : 5017.txt combinations

  1. give only 1st line
  2. give data validations for each field like junk data
  3. miss some data while uplaoding
  4. add no reason as last field if its pending or rejected
  5. date validations
  6. same record added twice
  7. total no of lines 5 but 3 lines in total
  8. file with a name other than 5017.txt


  Bugs/clarifications:

  1. timeout error duing execution of console application and star health master is not updated. fetch from finacle is fine.
  2. suppose when an error is generated during 'Validate data' mode in upload engine. Then there is link only to 'Generate Error Report'
     I guess there is a link for 'Delete Data upload' in some other module. Should it be there or not?
  3. mode: 'delete upload', upload id search is not showing any records and if given manually accepting
     same in case of ' verify upload'
  3. in 5017.txt, 1st line we woll provide date - shpuld it be current date? No its accepting all dates(past and future)
  5. when i give data in 5017.txt as 
        '1~5017|25-12-2017|2
	2~KGB100001|abc|123456|01-12-2017|200000|01-12-2019|R|REJECTED'
   during 'Validate data' mode, i got error as 'Invalid Bank Reference Number - KGB100001' 
   But this referencen no is present in star health master table.  - fixed 
   Tried difference bank refno numbers , but error is same. Please fix so that i can continue testing other combinations

  6. are there any specific customer code specific values??

  7. can policy date in policy details table be same as 'tran date' in master table??
  8. can policy no in policy details is same as proposal no in master table??
  9. upload engine 5017 accessible only to sections?? tried 40112 user id ... not alloiwing

Upload 5017 specific :

1. in data, 1st line date is present. Now all past and future dates are accepted. Guess current date should be allowed
   Even if date is not provided in 1st line of 5017.txt, it is aceepting n inserting.
2. After verfiy data, we will get msg as 'Data under Upload ID - 16943 validated successfully. Next Step - Verify Data '
   in msg 'Verify Upload' should be there.
3. if customer code is not provided in .txt file then still it is not throwing error in 'Validate data' mode.
    it shoud display as misisng customer code or something.
    data:

4. if policy code missing , then error is "Incorrect Date - Position 2 - This should be a date within 7 days including current date "
   guess not correct error message is thrown.
